hello it is almost 1:00 in the morning

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.160
because I am incredibly behind in this

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:16.760
class and this is going to be a minute

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:20.480
long video of me talking about I haven't

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.519
decided what yet but I have no problem

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.119
just talking especially at 1: in the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.160
morning I did have some friends over

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.800
here helping me with this

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:36.120
assignment and while I was struggling to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.480
figure out a couple problems they made

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.320
origami

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:47.239
ducks to be um a comfort animal for

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.320
these trying times this is duck number

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:55.000
one and this is duck number two they're

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.280

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.320

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:05.559
all nighter getting all the way caught

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.559
