Hello it is almost 1:00 in the morning because I am incredibly behind in this class. And this is going to be a minute long video of me talking about... I haven't decided what yet. But I have no problem just talking especially at 1:00 in the morning. I did have some friends over here helping me with this assignment, and while I was struggling to figure out a couple problems they made origami ducks to be um a comfort animal for these trying times. This is duck number one and, this is duck number two they're adorable. They bring me so much joy and now I think I will be able to pull an all nighter getting all the way caught up in this class. Wish me luck, thank you.
